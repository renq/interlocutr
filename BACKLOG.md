# The backlog

## High priority

1. Investigate https://github.com/krzysztofreczek/go-structurizr and try to use it in the project.
1. Create sites module to keep data about sites for which we keep the comments.
1. Create another implementation of comments storage (in files or sqlite)

## Less important ideas

1. Create dockerfiles, makefile, docker compose
1. Create github actions pipeline
1. Verify that referrer header matches to site settings
1. Create comment confirmation email
1. Create comment confirmation API
